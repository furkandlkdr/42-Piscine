# 42-Piscine
Repos' that I made in 42 Kocaeli

I'm trying to do it %100 but can't do all, so i made and fork some, i tried to write as possible as everyone can read and understand.

Don't copy and paste try to learn but if you copy as are, use norminette and gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra *.

And watch out for commits because not everything is final version as I'm using this as cloud.

To be spesific of all projects;

* BSQ not finished.
* C00 %85 (ex00-ex07)
* C01 %100
* C02 (not sure what was the % but i think %75 / ex0-ex11) (i didn't push ex12 for i couldn't tell)
* C03 %100
* C04 (not sure what was the % but i think %65 / ex00 - ex03) (ex04 and ex05 working but doesn't compile and KO error of them)
* C05 %75 (ex00-ex07)
* C06 %100
* Shell00 %50 (ex00-ex05)
* Shell01 didn't push but %100 possible
